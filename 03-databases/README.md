## Learning Mongoose

This project was created to learn and practice **Mongoose**, the MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js.

### What I learned
- How to define a **Mongoose schema**
- How to compile a schema into a **Model**
- How to interact with MongoDB using Mongoose models
- How to use important Mongoose features such as:
  - **Virtuals**
  - **Getters**
  - Other helpful schema options

### What I practiced
- Creating schemas with different field types
- Performing basic CRUD operations
- Using virtual properties to compute derived values
- Using getters to format data before it is returned

### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in Mongoose before applying it to larger full-stack applications.
